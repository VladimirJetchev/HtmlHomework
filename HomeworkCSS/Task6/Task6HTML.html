				<p>As in this columns exercise, the color change is detectable where the div meets the .jpg background. I used the same hexadecimal number in the PS doc as was used in the HTML?</p>
				
				<p>The exercise ses a main wrapper background. I get serious Float Drop when I resize (reduce ) the browser window. I think that is what "display:inline /"stops IE doubling magrin on flaot" is for but would like further explanation to understand this comment. </p>
				
				<p>Is keeping the wrapper div necessery in a stylesheet if there is also going to be seperate version wrappers as we have here to contain the different background images? Or perhaps this is example of the inner div as the book suggests? I am still confused on this detail. </p>
				
				<p>Even though I have auto margin siets on the wrapper div, the page still hugs the left side? I've tried on all of them but it won't budge. </p>
				
				<p>Obviously this folder has a mind of its own...It's in the wrapper, but the clear seems to be allowing it outside. However when I remove the clear it hugs the bottom of the header? </p>
